# Automated Price Predictor

## Overview
The Automated Price Predictor is a machine learning application designed to predict prices based on input data. It utilizes a series of steps to process data, train models, and make predictions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Python 3.7+**: The primary language for development.
- **Scikit-learn**: Used for implementing machine learning models.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.

## üîç Prediction Process

### 1. Data Collection
Data is gathered from various sources and stored in a structured format, typically as CSV files. This data includes features relevant to the pricing model, such as historical prices, product attributes, and market conditions.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- **Cleaning**: Remove duplicates, handle missing values, and correct inconsistencies.
- **Transformation**: Convert categorical variables into numerical formats using techniques like one-hot encoding.
- **Scaling**: Normalize or standardize numerical features to ensure they are on a similar scale, which helps improve model performance.

### 3. Feature Engineering
- **Creation**: Develop new features that may enhance model performance, such as interaction terms or polynomial features.
- **Selection**: Identify and retain the most relevant features using techniques like correlation analysis or recursive feature elimination.

### 4. Model Selection and Training
- Multiple machine learning models are considered, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
- The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
- Models are trained on the training set, learning the relationships between features and the target price.

### 5. Model Evaluation
- Models are evaluated using the testing set to assess their performance.
- Metrics such as R¬≤ Score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are used to compare models.
- The best-performing model is selected based on these metrics.

### 6. Hyperparameter Tuning
- Techniques like Grid Search or Random Search are used to optimize model parameters.
- This step involves adjusting parameters to improve model accuracy and generalization.

### 7. Prediction
- The trained and tuned model is used to make predictions on new, unseen data.
- Input data is preprocessed in the same way as the training data to ensure consistency.
- The model outputs predicted prices based on the input features.

### 8. Continuous Monitoring
- The model's performance is regularly monitored to ensure it remains accurate over time.
- The model is retrained as necessary to adapt to new data or changes in underlying patterns.

## Conclusion
The Automated Price Predictor leverages a structured approach to data handling, model training, and prediction. By following these steps, the system can provide accurate and reliable price predictions, aiding in decision-making processes.
